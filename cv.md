## **About me**
 My career was started in 2014 in a small Architecture Scaled Models workshop in Moscow. I self-studied most of the specific software for digital fabrication, needed for my job, and concurrently got a degree in Architecture. After graduation I joined PIK scaled models Workshop and mastered the way from regular specialist to team lead.  

During this period I did a lot of experiments with new technologies that could be useful for developing workshop production and implemented some of them for the team. Here I got my first experience in Javascript - making scripts for Adobe Illustrator to optimise work processes. Right away, that got me really interested in this new direction for professional growth.

My main strength and great passions  are constant learning and team working. So now I’m looking forward to use it in the field of web developing.
